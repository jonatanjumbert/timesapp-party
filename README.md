## What is about?
Time's App! is a charades-based party game for mobile devices also know as Time's up.

You simply have to form 2 teams 🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏼 and play the 3 rounds (basic mode) of the game trying to get the highest number of successes that the rival team in the **30-second turns** ⌛.

When the time runs out, it will touch the rival team and so on until the rounds of the game are completed.
